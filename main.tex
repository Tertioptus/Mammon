DDM (Dynamic Defined Modality)

Then why doesn't everybody do it?
	The next question is that if this type of planning is so crucial and so easy, why doesn't everybody do it.  We it's easy in comparison building a pyramid out of dirt and hay.
	Yet it can be a time consuming venture, that delays the availing of any tangible product. Much like gardening, in that most of the work is front loaded, and the harvest comes
	after an extended amount of time.  Plainly, it requires a great deal of faith.  Whereas you can decide to just eat grass.  And unless your a cow, you become sick.  
	Most people are either cows or vocationally sick.  The rest of us cultivate our time -- so that it will work for us.
